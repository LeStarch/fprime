# Svc::ComQueue (Active Component)

## 1. Introduction

`Svc::ComQueue` is an  FÂ´ active component that functions as a priority queue of buffer types. Messages are dequeued and
forwarded when a `Fw::Success::SUCCESS` signal is received in order of priority. Messages that result in a
`Fw::Success::FAILURE` signal are stored and retried on the first following `Fw::Success::SUCCESS` signal.

`Svc::ComQueue` is configured with a queue depth and queue priority for each incoming `Fw::Com` and `Fw::Buffer` port by
passing in a configuration table at initialization. Queued messages from the highest priority source port are serviced
first and a round-robin algorithm is used to balance between ports of shared priority.

`Svc::ComQueue` is designed to follow the
[communication adapter interface](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Design/communication-adapter-interface.html).

## 2. Assumptions

1. Incoming buffers to a given port are in priority order
2. Data is considered to be successfully sent when a `Fw::Success::SUCCESS` signal was received
3. The system includes a downstream
 [communications adapter](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Design/communication-adapter-interface.html)


## 3. Requirements


| Requirement      | Description                                                                                                                            | Rationale                                                               | Verification Method |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| SVC-COMQUEUE-001 | `Svc::ComQueue` shall queue `Fw:Buffer` and `Fw:ComBuffer` received on incoming ports.                                                 | The purpose of the queue is to store messages.                          | Unit Test           |
| SVC-COMQUEUE-002 | `Svc::ComQueue` shall output exactly one `Fw:Buffer` or `Fw:ComBuffer` message on a received `Fw::Success::SUCCESS` signal  .          | `Svc::ComQueue` obeys the communication adapter interface protocol.     | Unit Test           |
| SVC-COMQUEUE-003 | `Svc::ComQueue` shall retry sending the last sent message on the first `Fw::Success::SUCCESS` signal following `Fw::Success::FAILURE`. | In the case of failure messages shall not be lost.                      | Unit Test           |
| SVC-COMQUEUE-004 | `Svc::ComQueue` shall have a configurable number of `Fw::Com` and `Fw::Buffer` input ports.                                            | `Svc::ComQueue` should be adaptable for a number of projects.           | Inspection          |
| SVC-COMQUEUE-005 | `Svc::ComQueue` shall select and send the next priority `Fw:Buffer` and `Fw:ComBuffer` message in response to `Fw::Success::SUCCESS`.  | `Svc::ComQueue` obeys the communication adapter interface protocol.     | Unit test           |

### 4.2. Ports
`Svc::ComQueue` has the following ports:

| Kind          | Name              | Port Type             | Usage                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `output`      | `comQueueSend`    | `Fw.Com`              | Send prioritized message of `Fw::ComBuffer` type.       |
| `output`      | `buffQueueSend`   | `Fw.BufferSend`       | Send prioritized message of `Fw::Buffer` type.          |
| `async input` | `comStatusIn`     | `Fw.Success`          | Receive the status result of last message.              |
| `async input` | `run`             | `Svc.Sched`           | Emit periodic telemetry.                                |
| `async input` | `comQueueIn`      | `Fw.Com` Array        | Receive and queue `Fw::ComBuffer` type messages.        |
| `async input` | `buffQueueIn`     | `Fw.BufferSend` Array | Receive and queue `Fw::Buffer` type messages.           |
| `sync input`  | `retryReturn`     | `Fw.Buffersend`       | Returns `Fw.Buffer` for retry in-lieu of deallocation.  | 
| `output`      | `retryDeallocate` | `Fw.Buffersend`       | Deallocate `Fw.Buffer` when no longer needed for retry. |

### 4.3. State
`Svc::ComQueue` maintains the following state:
1. `m_queues`: An array of `Types::Queue` used to queue per-port messages.
2. `m_comRetry`: An instance of `Fw::ComBuffer` storing the last sent `Fw::ComBuffer` message.
3. `m_bufferRetry`: An instance of `Fw::Buffer` for storing the last sent `Fw::Buffer` message.
4. `m_prioritizedList`: An instance of `Svc::ComQueue::QueueMetadata` storing the priority-order queue metadata.
5. `m_lastIndex`: Incoming port index of last sent message.
6. `m_state`: An instance of `Svc::ComQueue::SendState` representing the state of the component.
7. `m_throttle`: An array of flags that throttle the per-port queue overflow messages.

### 4.4. Model Configuration
`Svc::ComQueue` has the following constants, that are configured in `AcConstants.fpp`:
1. `ComQueueComPorts`: number of ports of `Fw.Com` type in the `comQueueIn` port array.
2. `ComQueueBufferPorts` number of ports of `Fw.BufferSend` type in the `buffQueueIn` port array.

### 4.5. Runtime Setup
To set up an instance of `ComQueue`, the following needs to be done: 
1. Call the constructor and the init method in the usual way for an F Prime active component. 
2. Call the `configure` method, passing in an array of `QueueConfiguration` type, the size of the array, 
and an allocator of `Fw::MemAllocator`. The `configure` method foes the following:

   1. Ensures that the total size and config size are the same value
   2. Ensures that priority values range from 0 to the total size value
   3. Ensures that every entry in the queue containing the prioritized order of the com buffer and buffer data have been 
   initialized. 
   4. Ensures that there is enough memory for the com buffer and buffer data we want to process
   
### 4.6. Port Handlers

#### 4.6.1 buffQueueIn
The `buffQueueIn` port handler receives an `Fw::Buffer` data type and a port number. 
It does the following:
1. Ensures that the port number is between zero and the value of the buffer size 
2. Enqueue the buffer onto the `m_queues` instance 
3. Returns a warning if `m_queues` is full

In the case where the component is already in `READY` state, this will process the
queue immediately after enqueueing.


#### 4.6.2 comQueueIn
The `comQueueIn` port handler receives an `Fw::ComBuffer` data type and a port number. 
It does the following:
1. Ensures that the port number is between zero and the value of the com buffer size
2. Enqueue the com buffer onto the `m_queues` instance
3. Returns a warning if `m_queues` is full

In the case where the component is already in `READY` state, this will process the
queue immediately after enqueueing.

#### 4.6.3 comStatusIn
The `comStatusIn` port handler receives an `Svc::ComSendStatus` and it does the following:
1. If the status = `READY`, the function `retryQueue` or `processQueue` is called depending on if
`m_needRetry` has been set to true or false. If `m_needRetry` is equal to true, the function `retryQueue`
is invoked and `m_needRetry` is set to false, otherwise `processQueue` gets called. 
2. If the status = `FAIL`, `m_needRetry` is set to true. This step enables data to be resent. 
 
#### 4.6.4 run
The `run` port handler does the following: 
1. Construct an `ComQueueDepth` variable and `BuffQueueDepth` variable. 
The two variables are used to keep track of the largest tracked allocated size of
their respective type. 
2. Reports the largest tracked allocated size as telemetry. 

### 4.7. Helper Functions

#### 4.7.1 sendComBuffer
Stores the com buffer message, sends the com buffer message on the output port, and then sets the send state to waiting.

#### 4.7.2 sendBuffer
Stores the buffer message, sends the buffer message on the output port, and then sets the send state to waiting.

#### 4.7.3 retryQueue
Depending on the size of the last entry that is a type `QueueMetadata`, com buffer data
or buffer data will be sent out again. 

#### 4.7.4 processQueue
In a bounded loop that is constrained by the total size of the queue that contains both 
buffer and com buffer data, do:

   1. Check if there are any items on the queue, and continue with the loop if there are none. 
   2. Store the entry point of the queue based on the index of the array that contains the prioritized data.
   3. Compare the entry index with the value of the size of the queue that contains com buffer data.
      1. If it is less than the size value, then invoke the sendComBuffer function.
      2. If it is greater than the size value, then invoke the sendBuffer function. 
   4. Break out of the loop, but enter a new loop that starts at the next entry and linearly swap the remaining items in
the prioritized list.
